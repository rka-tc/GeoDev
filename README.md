Understanding the depth of the basement is crucial in various geological and geophysical studies,
as it provides valuable insights into the subsurface structure and potential resource exploration.
Satellite gravity data, acquired from gravity anomalies, offer a non-invasive and cost-effective
means to investigate the subsurface characteristics.
The research begins by collecting satellite gravity data from a designated study area, which
encompasses diverse geological formations. Spectral analysis techniques, including power
spectral density estimation and Fast Fourier transform, are employed to extract relevant
information from the gravity data. These methods enable the identification of significant spectral
peaks associated with subsurface anomalies, allowing for the estimation of basement depth.
Through the application of spectral analysis methods, the dissertation aims to address several key
objectives. First, it seeks to develop a robust methodology for processing satellite gravity data
and extracting meaningful information related to basement depth estimation. Second, it aims to
investigate the effectiveness and limitations of spectral analysis techniques in identifying spectral
peaks associated with basement structures. Third, it endeavors to evaluate the accuracy and
reliability of the estimated basement depths through comparison with existing ground truth data
or complementary geophysical methods.
